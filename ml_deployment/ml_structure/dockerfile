# Dockerfile

# 1. Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
# Using 'slim' is a good practice for smaller image sizes
FROM python:3.10.9-slim

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy the dependencies file first to leverage Docker's layer caching
COPY requirements.txt .

# 4. Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 5. Copy the rest of the application files into the container
COPY . .

# 6. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# 7. Define the command to run the application using gunicorn
# This is the command that will be executed when the container starts
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]

Overview
Create ML model serving pipeline with following components:

Data source: Use iris dataset as training dataset.
For serving, use Confluent Kafka to simulate training data base on their data schema
With Confluent Kafka, see avro schema to self-define your own simulated data structure (column names, min/max value,... ) Link https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-datagen/tree/master/src/main/resources

Model deployment: Google Vertex AI
See notebooks - Deploy model into an endpoint

Prediction control: Google Cloud Run
See in cloud_run_src to modify input / output of prediction result

Analytics package
Storage: Google Cloud Storage
Analytics / Monitoring: Google BigQuery, Looker Studio
Store result for monitoring, analytics
